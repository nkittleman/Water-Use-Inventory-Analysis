CPTY,Capacity,Value represents stated plant or pump capacity.
COAR,Coefficient Application Rate,Calculated using coefficient for an application rate.
COCP,Coefficient Per Capita,Calculated using a coefficient for per capita (livestock or humans).
COPW,Coefficient Power Consumption,Calculated using a coefficient for power consumption.
ESTM,Estimated,Value did not originate from a direct measurement with a meter or calculation using coefficients. It was computed using assumed pumping rate and estimated or measured time.
FMCU,Flowmeter Cumulative,A cumulative flowmeter was used to compute the value.
FMIN,Flowmeter Instantaneous,An instantaneous flowmeter was used to compute the value.
GAGE,Gaged,The value was obtained from a streamflow gage or weir.
MTUN,Metered Type Unknown,A meter was used to obtain the value but the type is unknown.
PERM,Permit,The value is the permitted number.
TTES,Time-Totalizer,A time-totalizer that provides an estimate of discharge was used.
TTIF,Time-Totalizer Flowmeter,A time-totalizer with an instantaneous flowmeter was used.
UNKN,Unknown,The measuring method is not known.
UNSP,Unspecified,A meter or coefficients were not used to obtain the value. The method used has not been specified.
MODL,Modeled,Estimated using a multi-variable model.
